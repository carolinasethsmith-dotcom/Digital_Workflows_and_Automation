# ⚙️ Digital Workflows & Automation

This repository explores **automation tools and workflows** to streamline tasks in data, education, and digital projects.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Experiment with **workflow automation** (Python, APIs, open-source tools).
- Recreate processes similar to **N8n** or **Zapier**, but free and customizable.
- Document examples for content creation, data organization, and reporting.

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms
- Python, Bash scripts
- Open APIs (Google, Notion, GitHub, etc.)
- Workflow managers and task schedulers
- Markdown documentation

## 🔄 Example Workflow
- Trigger: New file added to a folder
- Action: Extract metadata
- Automation: Generate a summary
- Output: Save to report or send via email
- 
## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add real examples (data labeling automation, document management, reporting).
- Build templates for reproducible workflows.
- Connect to your other projects (Astrotourism, Data Annotation).
